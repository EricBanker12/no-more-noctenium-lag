## No More Noctenium Lag
Tera-Proxy module for Tera Online. Blocks packets which caused client lag when using consumable Noctenium.
### Known Issues
* Client side Noctenium amount will not update until you open your inventory or you run out of Noctenium.
* Getting the last hit on an achievement mob/boss while using consumable Noctenium (not elixir) may delay achievement unlock client-side. Consuming any consumable in your inventory, advancing a different type of achievement, or relogging your character should fix this.
### Requirements
